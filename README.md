# Disease_Control_and_Prevention_Database
This is a group project for the course COMP-421 Database systems, offered by McGill Unversity in Winter 2020. 
The three project is consistant and correlated. 

## Description

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, we decide to designed a database tracking virus and patients in the world.
The project was devided into three steps.

In the first step (in folder p1), we built a conceptual model for the detabase.
We use an ER modle in to build the model.

In the second step (in folder p2), we implemented the detabase with PostgreSQL.
In this step, we also create some useful queries as examples that the database can be used for.

In the third step (in folder p2), we wrote a simple UI with Java and JDBC and some stored procedures for our databas.
